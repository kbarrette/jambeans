# jambeans
A jellybeans colorscheme, built using [Lush](https://github.com/rktjmp/lush.nvim).

Status: **alpha**

Based on my favorite color scheme, the beautiful [jellybeans](https://github.com/nanotech/jellybeans.vim).

`jambeans` looks very much like `jellybeans`, with some minor color tweaks, and
changes to things like "TODO" highlighting, git sign column colors, etc.
I've also added Tree-sitter highlight groups and a couple of plugin-specific
highlights.
